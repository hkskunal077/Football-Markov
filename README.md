# Football-Markov
The project aims to predict the Attacking Potential of Football teams based upon the statistics of 2011-12 English Premier League Table. A Markov Model is created where the field is divided into 3 parts, Defense Area, Midfield Area and Attack Area.


The project is in developement right now.
The Logistic Regression code will be uploaded shortly.
modellingfootballmarkovprocess.py files contains the python code for 
Data Preparation, Data Munging, and construction of Markov Chain using Python.







Project's Idea is based upon this pdf https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:828101/FULLTEXT01.pdf
